# Licenses

This README covers the details of the project's licensed dependencies, and how to use the
[licensed project][licensed-project] for caching and referencing those items.

Much of how the [licensed project][licensed-project] is used in this project
is derived from the [linguist project's usage][linguist-project-script] of the project.

## Managing the licensed dependencies

### Adding a new dependency

1. Add the dependency to `licensed`'s tracking, and as a submodule of this project:
   ```sh
   bin/add-licensed-dep https://github.com/github/linguist
   ```
2. Detail the specific files/directories impacted in this project's
   [LICENSED_DEPENDENCIES.yml][licensed-dependencies-file], found at the root
   of the project.
3. Re-generate the list of licensed dependencies at the end of this document.
   ```sh
   bin/list-licensed-dependencies
   ```

## Licensed dependencies and impacted files

Below is a list of licensed dependencies and impacted files,
generated by [github/licensed][licensed-project] using the configuration at

- [LICENSED_DEPENDENCIES.yml]([licensed-dependencies-file])
- [Dependency submodules and extracted licenses](./licenses)

Details related to any individual dependency's license, including any
relevant content (*i.e.* the License and Copyright Notices themselves)
are made available in the
[the `licenses` directory](./licenses).
